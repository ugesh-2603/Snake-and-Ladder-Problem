Players roll a die and navigate the board. Landing on a ladder advances a player to a square further up the board, while landing on a snake means they have to go back to a previous square. The aim of the game is to reach the final square. The game is a race that's based on sheer luck, and is popular with children.


Rules And Regulations :

Each player puts their counter on the space that says 'start here'.
Take it in turns to roll the dice. Move your counter forward the number of spaces shown on the dice.
If your counter lands at the bottom of a ladder, you can move up to the top of the ladder.
If your counter lands on the head of a snake, you must slide down to the bottom of the snake.
The first player to get to the space that says 'home' is the winner.
